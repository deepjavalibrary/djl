    "# Transfer Learning on CIFAR-10 Dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you learn how to train an image classification model using [Transfer Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). Transfer learning is a popular machine learning technique that uses a model trained on one problem and applies it to a second related problem. Compared to training from scratch or designing a model for your specific problem, transfer learning can leverage the features already learned on a similar problem and produce a more robust model in a much shorter time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train your model with the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. As for the pre-trained model, use the ResNet50v1[1] model. It's a 50 layer deep model already trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), a much larger dataset consisting of over 1.2 million images in 1000 classes. Modify it to classify 10 classes from the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",

Note this model was trained on ImageNet with 1000 classes; the last layer is a Linear layer with 1000 output channels. Because you are repurposing it on CIFAR10 with 10 classes, you need to remove the last layer and add a new Linear layer with 10 output channels.
