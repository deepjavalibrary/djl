    "In order to train, you must create a [Dataset class](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/dataset/Dataset.html) to contain your training data. A dataset is a collection of sample input/output pairs for the function represented by your neural network. Each single input/output is represented by a [Record](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/dataset/Record.html). Each record could have multiple arrays of inputs or outputs such as an image question and answer dataset where the input is both an image and a question about the image while the output is the answer to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because data learning is highly parallelizable, training is often done not with a single record at a time, but a [Batch](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/dataset/Batch.html). This can lead to significant performance gains, especially when working with images\n",

    "## Sampler\n",

The only parameter we need for MNIST is the choice of [Sampler](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/dataset/Sampler.html). The sampler decides which and how many element from datasets are part of each batch when iterating through it. We will have it randomly shuffle the elements for the batch and use a batchSize of 32. The batchSize is usually the largest power of 2 that fits within memory."

The trainer is the main class to orchestrate the training process. Usually, they will be opened using a try-with-resources and closed after training is over.\n",

    "* **REQUIRED** [`Loss`](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/loss/Loss.html) function: A loss function is used to measure how well our model matches the dataset. Because the lower value of the function is better, it's called the \"loss\" function. The Loss is the only required argument to the model\n",
    "* [`Evaluator`](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/evaluator/Evaluator.html) function: An evaluator function is also used to measure how well our model matches the dataset. Unlike the loss, they are only there for people to look at and are not used for optimizing the model. Since many losses are not as intuitive, adding other evaluators such as Accuracy can help to understand how your model is doing. If you know of any useful evaluators, we recommend adding them.\n",
    "* [`Training Listeners`](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/repository/zoo/ZooModel.html): The training listener adds additional functionality to the training process through a listener interface. This can include showing training progress, stopping early if training becomes undefined, or recording performance metrics. We offer several easy sets of [default listeners](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/repository/zoo/ZooModel.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also configure other options such as the Device, Initializer, and Optimizer. See [more details](https://javadoc.io/static/ai.djl/api/0.12.0/index.html?ai/djl/training/TrainingConfig.html)."
