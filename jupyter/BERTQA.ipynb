    "# DJL BERT Inference Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you walk through running inference using DJL on a [BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270) QA model trained with MXNet and PyTorch. \n",
    "You can provide a question and a paragraph containing the answer to the model. The model is then able to find the best answer from the answer paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Q: When did BBC Japan start broadcasting?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer paragraph:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "BBC Japan was a general entertainment channel, which operated between December 2004 and April 2006.\n",
    "It ceased operations after its Japanese distributor folded.\n",
    "```\n",
    "And it picked the right answer:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "A: December 2004\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of DJL is that it's engine agnostic. Because of this, you can run different backend engines seamlessly. We showcase BERT QA first with an MXNet pre-trained model, then with a PyTorch model."
