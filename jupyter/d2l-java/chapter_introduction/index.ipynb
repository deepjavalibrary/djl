    "\n",
    ":label:`chap_introduction`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, nearly every computer program that we interact with daily\n",
    "was coded by software developers from first principles.\n",
    "Say that we wanted to write an application to manage an e-commerce platform.  After huddling around a whiteboard for a few hours to ponder the problem,\n",
    "we would come up with the broad strokes of a working solution that might probably look something like this:\n",
    "(i) users interact with the application through an interface\n",
    "running in a web browser or mobile application;\n",
    "(ii) our application interacts with a commercial-grade database engine\n",
    "to keep track of each user's state and maintain records\n",
    "of historical transactions; and (iii) at the heart of our application,\n",
    "the *business logic* (you might say, the *brains*) of our application\n",
    "spells out in methodical detail the appropriate action\n",
    "that our program should take in every conceivable circumstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the *brains* of our application,\n",
    "we'd have to step through every possible corner case\n",
    "that we anticipate encountering, devising appropriate rules.\n",
    "Each time a customer clicks to add an item to their shopping cart,\n",
    "we add an entry to the shopping cart database table,\n",
    "associating that user's ID with the requested product’s ID.\n",
    "While few developers ever get it completely right the first time\n",
    "(it might take some test runs to work out the kinks),\n",
    "for the most part, we could write such a program from first principles\n",
    "and confidently launch it *before ever seeing a real customer*.\n",
    "Our ability to design automated systems from first principles\n",
    "that drive functioning products and systems, often in novel situations,\n",
    "is a remarkable cognitive feat.\n",
    "And when you are able to devise solutions that work $100\\%$ of the time,\n",
    "*you should not be using machine learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for the growing community of machine learning (ML) scientists,\n",
    "many tasks that we would like to automate\n",
    "do not bend so easily to human ingenuity.\n",
    "Imagine huddling around the whiteboard with the smartest minds you know,\n",
    "but this time you are tackling one of the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a program that predicts tomorrow's weather given geographic\n",
    "information, satellite images, and a trailing window of past weather.\n",
    "* Write a program that takes in a question, expressed in free-form text, and\n",
    " answers it correctly.\n",
    "* Write a program that given an image can identify all the people it contains,\n",
    " drawing outlines around each.\n",
    "* Write a program that presents users with products that they are likely to\n",
    "  enjoy but unlikely, in the natural course of browsing, to encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, even elite programmers\n",
    "are incapable of coding up solutions from scratch.\n",
    "The reasons for this can vary. Sometimes the program\n",
    "that we are looking for follows a pattern that changes over time,\n",
    "and we need our programs to adapt.\n",
    "In other cases, the relationship (say between pixels,\n",
    "and abstract categories) may be too complicated,\n",
    "requiring thousands or millions of computations\n",
    "that are beyond our conscious understanding\n",
    "(even if our eyes manage the task effortlessly).\n",
    "ML is the study of powerful\n",
    "techniques that can *learn* from *experience*.\n",
    "As an ML algorithm accumulates more experience,\n",
    "typically in the form of observational data or\n",
    "interactions with an environment, its performance improves.\n",
    "Contrast this with our deterministic e-commerce platform,\n",
    "which performs according to the same business logic,\n",
    "no matter how much experience accrues,\n",
    "until the developers themselves *learn* and decide\n",
    "that it is time to update the software.\n",
    "In this book, we will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning,\n",
    "and focus in particular on deep learning, a powerful set of techniques\n",
    "driving innovations in areas as diverse as computer vision,\n",
    "natural language processing, healthcare, and genomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Motivating Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we could begin writing, the authors of this book,\n",
    "like much of the work force, had to become caffeinated.\n",
    "We hopped in the car and started driving.\n",
    "Using an iPhone, Alex called out \"Hey Siri\",\n",
    "awakening the phone's voice recognition system.\n",
    "Then Mu commanded \"directions to Blue Bottle coffee shop\".\n",
    "The phone quickly displayed the transcription of his command.\n",
    "It also recognized that we were asking for directions\n",
    "and launched the Maps application to fulfill our request.\n",
    "Once launched, the Maps app identified a number of routes.\n",
    "Next to each route, the phone displayed a predicted transit time.\n",
    "While we fabricated this story for pedagogical convenience,\n",
    "it demonstrates that in the span of just a few seconds,\n",
    "our everyday interactions with a smart phone\n",
    "can engage several machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine just writing a program to respond to a *wake word*\n",
    "like \"Alexa\", \"Okay, Google\" or \"Siri\".\n",
    "Try coding it up in a room by yourself\n",
    "with nothing but a computer and a code editor,\n",
    "as illustrated in :numref:`fig_wake_word`.\n",
    "How would you write such a program from first principles?\n",
    "Think about it... the problem is hard.\n",
    "Every second, the microphone will collect roughly 44,000 samples.\n",
    "Each sample is a measurement of the amplitude of the sound wave.\n",
    "What rule could map reliably from a snippet of raw audio to confident predictions ``{yes, no}`` on whether the snippet contains the wake word?\n",
    "If you are stuck, do not worry.\n",
    "We do not know how to write such a program from scratch either.\n",
    "That is why we use ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Identify an awake word.](../img/wake-word.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    ":label:`fig_wake_word`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the trick.\n",
    "Often, even when we do not know how to tell a computer\n",
    "explicitly how to map from inputs to outputs,\n",
    "we are nonetheless capable of performing the cognitive feat ourselves.\n",
    "In other words, even if you do not know\n",
    "*how to program a computer* to recognize the word \"Alexa\",\n",
    "you yourself *are able* to recognize the word \"Alexa\".\n",
    "Armed with this ability, we can collect a huge *dataset*\n",
    "containing examples of audio and label those that *do*\n",
    "and that *do not* contain the wake word.\n",
    "In the ML approach, we do not attempt to design a system\n",
    "*explicitly* to recognize wake words.\n",
    "Instead, we define a flexible program\n",
    "whose behavior is determined by a number of *parameters*.\n",
    "Then we use the dataset to determine the best possible set of parameters, those that improve the performance of our program\n",
    "with respect to some measure of performance on the task of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the parameters as knobs that we can turn,\n",
    "manipulating the behavior of the program.\n",
    "Fixing the parameters, we call the program a *model*.\n",
    "The set of all distinct programs (input-output mappings)\n",
    "that we can produce just by manipulating the parameters\n",
    "is called a *family* of models.\n",
    "And the *meta-program* that uses our dataset\n",
    "to choose the parameters is called a *learning algorithm*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can go ahead and engage the learning algorithm,\n",
    "we have to define the problem precisely,\n",
    "pinning down the exact nature of the inputs and outputs,\n",
    "and choosing an appropriate model family.\n",
    "In this case, our model receives a snippet of audio as *input*,\n",
    "and it generates a selection among ``{yes, no}`` as *output*.\n",
    "If all goes according to plan the model's guesses will\n",
    "typically be correct as to whether (or not) the snippet contains the wake word.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose the right family of models,\n",
    "then there should exist one setting of the knobs\n",
    "such that the model fires ``yes`` every time it hears the word \"Alexa\".  Because the exact choice of the wake word is arbitrary,\n",
    "we will probably need a model family sufficiently rich that,\n",
    "via another setting of the knobs, it could fire ``yes``\n",
    "only upon hearing the word \"Apricot\".\n",
    "We expect that the same model family should be suitable\n",
    "for *\"Alexa\" recognition* and *\"Apricot\" recognition*\n",
    "because they seem, intuitively, to be similar tasks.\n",
    "However, we might need a different family of models entirely\n",
    "if we want to deal with fundamentally different inputs or outputs,\n",
    "say if we wanted to map from images to captions,\n",
    "or from English sentences to Chinese sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, if we just set all of the knobs randomly,\n",
    "it is not likely that our model will recognize \"Alexa\",\n",
    "\"Apricot\", or any other English word.\n",
    "In deep learning, the *learning* is the process\n",
    "by which we discover the right setting of the knobs\n",
    "coercing the desired behavior from our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in :numref:`fig_ml_loop`, the training process usually looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start off with a randomly initialized model that cannot do anything useful.\n",
    "1. Grab some of your labeled data (e.g., audio snippets and corresponding ``{yes, no}`` labels)\n",
    "1. Tweak the knobs so the model sucks less with respect to those examples\n",
    "1. Repeat until the model is awesome.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A typical training process. ](../img/ml-loop.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    ":label:`fig_ml_loop`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, rather than code up a wake word recognizer,\n",
    "we code up a program that can *learn* to recognize wake words,\n",
    "*if we present it with a large labeled dataset*.\n",
    "You can think of this act of determining a program's behavior\n",
    "by presenting it with a dataset as *programming with data*.\n",
    "We can \"program\" a cat detector by providing our machine learning system\n",
    "with many examples of cats and dogs, such as the images below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|cat|cat|dog|dog|\n",
    "|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n",
    "|![cat3](../img/cat3.jpg)|![](../img/cat2.jpg)|![](../img/dog1.jpg)|![](../img/dog2.jpg)|\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the detector will eventually learn to emit a very large positive number if it is a cat, a very large negative number if it is a dog,\n",
    "and something closer to zero if it is not sure,\n",
    "and this barely scratches the surface of what ML can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is just one among many popular methods\n",
    "for solving machine learning problems.\n",
    "Thus far, we have only talked about machine learning broadly\n",
    "and not deep learning. To see why deep learning is important,\n",
    "we should pause for a moment to highlight a couple of crucial points.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the problems that we have discussed thus far---learning\n",
    "from the raw audio signal, the raw pixel values of images,\n",
    "or mapping between sentences of arbitrary lengths and\n",
    "their counterparts in foreign languages---are problems\n",
    "where deep learning excels and where traditional ML methods faltered.\n",
    "Deep models are *deep* in precisely the sense\n",
    "that they learn many *layers* of computation.\n",
    "It turns out that these many-layered (or hierarchical) models\n",
    "are capable of addressing low-level perceptual data\n",
    "in a way that previous tools could not.\n",
    "In bygone days, the crucial part of applying ML to these problems\n",
    "consisted of coming up with manually-engineered ways\n",
    "of transforming the data into some form amenable to *shallow* models.\n",
    "One key advantage of deep learning is that it replaces not\n",
    "only the *shallow* models at the end of traditional learning pipelines,\n",
    "but also the labor-intensive process of feature engineering.\n",
    "Second, by replacing much of the *domain-specific preprocessing*,\n",
    "deep learning has eliminated many of the boundaries\n",
    "that previously separated computer vision, speech recognition,\n",
    "natural language processing, medical informatics, and other application areas,\n",
    "offering a unified set of tools for tackling diverse problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Key Components: Data, Models, and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In our *wake-word* example, we described a dataset\n",
    "consisting of audio snippets and binary labels, and we\n",
    "gave a hand-wavy sense of how we might *train*\n",
    "a model to approximate a mapping from snippets to classifications.\n",
    "This sort of problem, where we try to predict a designated unknown *label*\n",
    "given known *inputs*, given a dataset consisting of examples,\n",
    "for which the labels are known is called *supervised learning*,\n",
    "and it is just one among many *kinds* of machine learning problems.\n",
    "In the next section, we will take a deep dive into the different ML problems.\n",
    "First, we'd like to shed more light on some core components\n",
    "that will follow us around, no matter what kind of ML problem we take on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *data* that we can learn from.\n",
    "2. A *model* of how to transform the data.\n",
    "3. A *loss* function that quantifies the *badness* of our model.\n",
    "4. An *algorithm* to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "It might go without saying that you cannot do data science without data.\n",
    "We could lose hundreds of pages pondering what precisely constitutes data,\n",
    "but for now, we will err on the practical side\n",
    "and focus on the key properties to be concerned with.\n",
    "Generally, we are concerned with a collection of *examples*\n",
    "(also called *data points*, *samples*, or *instances*).\n",
    "In order to work with data usefully, we typically\n",
    "need to come up with a suitable numerical representation.\n",
    "Each *example* typically consists of a collection\n",
    "of numerical attributes called *features*.\n",
    "In the supervised learning problems above,\n",
    "a special feature is designated as the prediction *target*,\n",
    "(sometimes called the *label* or *dependent variable*).\n",
    "The given features from which the model must make its predictions\n",
    "can then simply be called the *features*,\n",
    "(or often, the *inputs*, *covariates*, or *independent variables*).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were working with image data,\n",
    "each individual photograph might constitute an *example*,\n",
    "each represented by an ordered list of numerical values\n",
    "corresponding to the brightness of each pixel.\n",
    "A $200\\times 200$ color photograph would consist of $200\\times200\\times3=120000$\n",
    "numerical values, corresponding to the brightness\n",
    "of the red, green, and blue channels for each spatial location.\n",
    "In a more traditional task, we might try to predict\n",
    "whether or not a patient will survive,\n",
    "given a standard set of features such as age, vital signs, diagnoses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When every example is characterized by the same number of numerical values,\n",
    "we say that the data consists of *fixed-length* vectors\n",
    "and we describe the (constant) length of the vectors\n",
    "as the *dimensionality* of the data.\n",
    "As you might imagine, fixed-length can be a convenient property.\n",
    "If we wanted to train a model to recognize cancer in microscopy images,\n",
    "fixed-length inputs mean we have one less thing to worry about.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all data can easily be represented as fixed-length vectors.\n",
    "While we might expect microscope images to come from standard equipment,\n",
    "we cannot expect images mined from the Internet\n",
    "to all show up with the same resolution or shape.\n",
    "For images, we might consider cropping them all to a standard size,\n",
    "but that strategy only gets us so far.\n",
    "We risk losing information in the cropped out portions.\n",
    "Moreover, text data resists fixed-length representations even more stubbornly.\n",
    "Consider the customer reviews left on e-commerce sites\n",
    "like Amazon, IMDB, or TripAdvisor.\n",
    "Some are short: \"it stinks!\". Others ramble for pages.\n",
    "One major advantage of deep learning over traditional methods\n",
    "is the comparative grace with which modern models\n",
    "can handle *varying-length* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the more data we have, the easier our job becomes.\n",
    "When we have more data, we can train more powerful models\n",
    "and rely less heavily on pre-conceived assumptions.\n",
    "The regime change from (comparatively) small to big data\n",
    "is a major contributor to the success of modern deep learning.\n",
    "To drive the point home, many of the most exciting models in deep learning do not work without large datasets.\n",
    "Some others work in the low-data regime,\n",
    "but are no better than traditional approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is not enough to have lots of data and to process it cleverly.\n",
    "We need the *right* data. If the data is full of mistakes,\n",
    "or if the chosen features are not predictive\n",
    "of the target quantity of interest, learning is going to fail.\n",
    "The situation is captured well by the cliché: *garbage in, garbage out*.\n",
    "Moreover, poor predictive performance is not the only potential consequence.\n",
    "In sensitive applications of machine learning,\n",
    "like predictive policing, resumé screening, and risk models used for lending,\n",
    "we must be especially alert to the consequences of garbage data.\n",
    "One common failure mode occurs in datasets where some groups of people\n",
    "are unrepresented in the training data.\n",
    "Imagine applying a skin cancer recognition system in the wild\n",
    "that had never seen black skin before.\n",
    "Failure can also occur when the data\n",
    "does not merely under-represent some groups\n",
    "but reflects societal prejudices.\n",
    "For example, if past hiring decisions are used to train a predictive model\n",
    "that will be used to screen resumes,\n",
    "then machine learning models could inadvertently\n",
    "capture and automate historical injustices.\n",
    "Note that this can all happen without the data scientist\n",
    "actively conspiring, or even being aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning involves *transforming* the data in some sense.\n",
    "We might want to build a system that ingests photos and predicts *smiley-ness*.\n",
    "Alternatively, we might want to ingest a set of sensor readings\n",
    "and predict how *normal* vs *anomalous* the readings are.\n",
    "By *model*, we denote the computational machinery for ingesting data\n",
    "of one type, and spitting out predictions of a possibly different type.\n",
    "In particular, we are interested in statistical models\n",
    "that can be estimated from data.\n",
    "While simple models are perfectly capable of addressing\n",
    "appropriately simple problems the problems\n",
    "that we focus on in this book stretch the limits of classical methods.\n",
    "Deep learning is differentiated from classical approaches\n",
    "principally by the set of powerful models that it focuses on.\n",
    "These models consist of many successive transformations of the data\n",
    "that are chained together top to bottom, thus the name *deep learning*.\n",
    "On our way to discussing deep neural networks,\n",
    "we will discuss some more traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Objective functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we introduced machine learning as \"learning from experience\".\n",
    "By *learning* here, we mean *improving* at some task over time.\n",
    "But who is to say what constitutes an improvement?\n",
    "You might imagine that we could propose to update our model,\n",
    "and some people might disagree on whether the proposed update\n",
    "constituted an improvement or a decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to develop a formal mathematical system of learning machines,\n",
    "we need to have formal measures of how good (or bad) our models are.\n",
    "In machine learning, and optimization more generally,\n",
    "we call these objective functions.\n",
    "By convention, we usually define objective functions\n",
    "so that *lower* is *better*.\n",
    "This is merely a convention. You can take any function $f$\n",
    "for which higher is better, and turn it into a new function $f'$\n",
    "that is qualitatively identical but for which lower is better\n",
    "by setting $f' = -f$.\n",
    "Because lower is better, these functions are sometimes called\n",
    "*loss functions* or *cost functions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to predict numerical values,\n",
    "the most common objective function is squared error $(y-\\hat{y})^2$.\n",
    "For classification, the most common objective is to minimize error rate,\n",
    "i.e., the fraction of instances on which\n",
    "our predictions disagree with the ground truth.\n",
    "Some objectives (like squared error) are easy to optimize.\n",
    "Others (like error rate) are difficult to optimize directly,\n",
    "owing to non-differentiability or other complications.\n",
    "In these cases, it is common to optimize a *surrogate objective*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the loss function is defined\n",
    "with respect to the model's parameters\n",
    "and depends upon the dataset.\n",
    "The best values of our model's parameters are learned\n",
    "by minimizing the loss incurred on a *training set*\n",
    "consisting of some number of *examples* collected for training.\n",
    "However, doing well on the training data\n",
    "does not guarantee that we will do well on (unseen) test data.\n",
    "So we will typically want to split the available data into two partitions:\n",
    "the training data (for fitting model parameters)\n",
    "and the test data (which is held out for evaluation),\n",
    "reporting the following two quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Training Error:**\n",
    " The error on that data on which the model was trained.\n",
    " You could think of this as being like\n",
    " a student's scores on practice exams\n",
    " used to prepare for some real exam.\n",
    " Even if the results are encouraging,\n",
    " that does not guarantee success on the final exam.\n",
    " * **Test Error:** This is the error incurred on an unseen test set.\n",
    " This can deviate significantly from the training error.\n",
    " When a model performs well on the training data\n",
    " but fails to generalize to unseen data,\n",
    " we say that it is *overfitting*.\n",
    " In real-life terms, this is like flunking the real exam\n",
    " despite doing well on practice exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have got some data source and representation,\n",
    "a model, and a well-defined objective function,\n",
    "we need an algorithm capable of searching\n",
    "for the best possible parameters for minimizing the loss function.\n",
    "The most popular optimization algorithms for neural networks\n",
    "follow an approach called gradient descent.\n",
    "In short, at each step, they check to see, for each parameter,\n",
    "which way the training set loss would move\n",
    "if you perturbed that parameter just a small amount.\n",
    "They then update the parameter in the direction that reduces the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kinds of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we discuss a few *kinds*\n",
    "of machine learning problems in greater detail.\n",
    "We begin with a list of *objectives*, i.e.,\n",
    "a list of things that we would like machine learning to do.\n",
    "Note that the objectives are complemented\n",
    "with a set of techniques of *how* to accomplish them,\n",
    "including types of data, models, training techniques, etc.\n",
    "The list below is just a sampling of the problems ML can tackle\n",
    "to motivate the reader and provide us with some common language\n",
    "for when we talk about more problems throughout the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning addresses the task of\n",
    "predicting *targets* given *inputs*.\n",
    "The targets, which we often call *labels*, are generally denoted by *y*.\n",

    "#### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest supervised learning task\n",
    "to wrap your head around is *regression*.\n",
    "Consider, for example, a set of data harvested\n",
    "from a database of home sales.\n",
    "We might construct a table, where each row corresponds to a different house,\n",
    "and each column corresponds to some relevant attribute,\n",
    "such as the square footage of a house, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the number of minutes (walking) to the center of town.\n",
    "In this dataset, each *example* would be a specific house,\n",
    "and the corresponding *feature vector* would be one row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you live in New York or San Francisco,\n",
    "and you are not the CEO of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, or Facebook,\n",
    "the (sq. footage, no. of bedrooms, no. of bathrooms, walking distance)\n",
    "feature vector for your home might look something like: $[100, 0, .5, 60]$.\n",
    "However, if you live in Pittsburgh, it might look more like $[3000, 4, 3, 10]$.\n",
    "Feature vectors like this are essential\n",
    "for most classic machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "We will continue to denote the feature vector corresponding\n",
    "to any example $i$ as $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and we can compactly refer\n",
    "to the full table containing all of the feature vectors as $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a problem a *regression* is actually the outputs.\n",
    "Say that you are in the market for a new home.\n",
    "You might want to estimate the fair market value of a house,\n",
    "given some features like these.\n",
    "The target value, the price of sale, is a *real number*.\n",
    "If you remember the formal definition of the reals\n",
    "you might be scratching your head now.\n",
    "Homes probably never sell for fractions of a cent,\n",
    "let alone prices expressed as irrational numbers.\n",
    "In cases like this, when the target is actually discrete,\n",
    "but where the rounding takes place on a sufficiently fine scale,\n",
    "we will abuse language just a bit and continue to describe\n",
    "our outputs and targets as real-valued numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote any individual target $y_i$\n",
    "(corresponding to example $\\mathbf{x}i$)\n",
    "and the set of all targets $\\mathbf{y}$\n",
    "(corresponding to all examples $X$).\n",
    "When our targets take on arbitrary values in some range,\n",
    "we call this a regression problem.\n",
    "Our goal is to produce a model whose predictions\n",
    "closely approximate the actual target values.\n",
    "We denote the predicted target for any instance $\\hat{y}_i$.\n",
    "Do not worry if the notation is bogging you down.\n",
    "We will unpack it more thoroughly in the subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of practical problems are well-described regression problems.\n",
    "Predicting the rating that a user will assign to a movie\n",
    "can be thought of as a regression problem\n",
    "and if you designed a great algorithm to accomplish this feat in 2009,\n",
    "you might have won the [1-million-dollar Netflix prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize).\n",
    "Predicting the length of stay for patients in the hospital\n",
    "is also a regression problem.\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that any *How much?* or *How many?* problem\n",
    "should suggest regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"How many hours will this surgery take?\": *regression*\n",
    "* \"How many dogs are in this photo?\": *regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you can easily pose your problem as \"Is this a _ ?\",\n",
    "then it is likely, classification, a different kind\n",
    "of supervised problem that we will cover next.\n",
    "Even if you have never worked with machine learning before,\n",
    "you have probably worked through a regression problem informally.\n",
    "Imagine, for example, that you had your drains repaired\n",
    "and that your contractor spent $x_1=3$ hours\n",
    "removing gunk from your sewage pipes.\n",
    "Then she sent you a bill of $y_1 = \\$350$.\n",
    "Now imagine that your friend hired the same contractor for $x_2 = 2$ hours\n",
    "and that she received a bill of $y_2 = \\$250$.\n",
    "If someone then asked you how much to expect\n",
    "on their upcoming gunk-removal invoice\n",
    "you might make some reasonable assumptions,\n",
    "such as more hours worked costs more dollars.\n",
    "You might also assume that there is some base charge\n",
    "and that the contractor then charges per hour.\n",
    "If these assumptions held true, then given these two data points,\n",
    "you could already identify the contractor's pricing structure:\n",
    "\\$100 per hour plus \\$50 to show up at your house.\n",
    "If you followed that much then you already understand\n",
    "the high-level idea behind linear regression\n",
    "(and you just implicitly designed a linear model with a bias term).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we could produce the parameters\n",
    "that exactly matched the contractor's prices.\n",
    "Sometimes that is not possible, e.g., if some of\n",
    "the variance owes to some factors besides your two features.\n",
    "In these cases, we will try to learn models\n",
    "that minimize the distance between our predictions and the observed values.\n",
    "In most of our chapters, we will focus on one of two very common losses,\n",
    "the [L1 loss](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/loss.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.L1Loss)\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(y, y') = \\sum_i |y_i-y_i'|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the least mean squares loss, or\n",
    "[L2 loss](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/loss.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.L2Loss),\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(y, y') = \\sum_i (y_i - y_i')^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see later, the $L_2$ loss corresponds to the assumption\n",
    "that our data was corrupted by Gaussian noise,\n",
    "whereas the $L_1$ loss corresponds to an assumption\n",
    "of noise from a Laplace distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "While regression models are great for addressing *how many?* questions,\n",
    "lots of problems do not bend comfortably to this template.\n",
    "For example, a bank wants to add check scanning to its mobile app.\n",
    "This would involve the customer snapping a photo of a check\n",
    "with their smart phone's camera\n",
    "and the machine learning model would need to be able\n",
    "to automatically understand text seen in the image.\n",
    "It would also need to understand hand-written text to be even more robust.\n",
    "This kind of system is referred to as optical character recognition (OCR),\n",
    "and the kind of problem it addresses is called *classification*.\n",
    "It is treated with a different set of algorithms\n",
    "than those used for regression (although many techniques will carry over).\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, we want our model to look at a feature vector,\n",
    "e.g., the pixel values in an image,\n",
    "and then predict which category (formally called *classes*),\n",
    "among some (discrete) set of options, an example belongs.\n",
    "For hand-written digits, we might have 10 classes,\n",
    "corresponding to the digits 0 through 9.\n",
    "The simplest form of classification is when there are only two classes,\n",
    "a problem which we call binary classification.\n",
    "For example, our dataset $X$ could consist of images of animals\n",
    "and our *labels* $Y$ might be the classes $\\mathrm{\\{cat, dog\\}}$.\n",
    "While in regression, we sought a *regressor* to output a real value $\\hat{y}$,\n",
    "in classification, we seek a *classifier*, whose output $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted class assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reasons that we will get into as the book gets more technical,\n",
    "it can be hard to optimize a model that can only output\n",
    "a hard categorical assignment, e.g., either *cat* or *dog*.\n",
    "In these cases, it is usually much easier to instead express\n",
    "our model in the language of probabilities.\n",
    "Given an example $x$, our model assigns a probability $\\hat{y}_k$\n",
    "to each label $k$. Because these are probabilities,\n",
    "they need to be positive numbers and add up to $1$\n",
    "and thus we only need $K-1$ numbers\n",
    "to assign probabilities of $K$ categories.\n",
    "This is easy to see for binary classification.\n",
    "If there is a $0.6$ ($60\\%$) probability that an unfair coin comes up heads,\n",
    "then there is a $0.4$ ($40\\%$) probability that it comes up tails.\n",
    "Returning to our animal classification example,\n",
    "a classifier might see an image and output the probability\n",
    "that the image is a cat $P(y=\\text{cat} \\mid x) = 0.9$.\n",
    "We can interpret this number by saying that the classifier\n",
    "is $90\\%$ sure that the image depicts a cat.\n",
    "The magnitude of the probability for the predicted class\n",
    "conveys one notion of uncertainty.\n",
    "It is not the only notion of uncertainty\n",
    "and we will discuss others in more advanced chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have more than two possible classes,\n",
    "we call the problem *multiclass classification*.\n",
    "Common examples include hand-written character recognition\n",
    "`[0, 1, 2, 3 ... 9, a, b, c, ...]`.\n",
    "While we attacked regression problems by trying\n",
    "to minimize the L1 or L2 loss functions,\n",
    "the common loss function for classification problems is called cross-entropy.\n",
    "In MXNet Gluon, the corresponding loss function can be found [here](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/loss.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the most likely class is not necessarily\n",
    "the one that you are going to use for your decision.\n",
    "Assume that you find this beautiful mushroom in your backyard\n",
    "as shown in :numref:`fig_death_cap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Death cap---do not eat!](../img/death_cap.jpg)\n",

    ":width:`200px`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":label:`fig_death_cap`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume that you built a classifier and trained it\n",
    "to predict if a mushroom is poisonous based on a photograph.\n",
    "Say our poison-detection classifier outputs\n",
    "$P(y=\\mathrm{death cap}|\\mathrm{image}) = 0.2$.\n",
    "In other words, the classifier is $80\\%$ sure\n",
    "that our mushroom *is not* a death cap.\n",
    "Still, you'd have to be a fool to eat it.\n",
    "That is because the certain benefit of a delicious dinner\n",
    "is not worth a $20\\%$ risk of dying from it.\n",
    "In other words, the effect of the *uncertain risk*\n",
    "outweighs the benefit by far. We can look at this more formally.\n",
    "Basically, we need to compute the expected risk that we incur,\n",
    "i.e., we need to multiply the probability of the outcome\n",
    "with the benefit (or harm) associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathrm{action}| x) = E_{y \\sim p(y| x)}[\\mathrm{loss}(\\mathrm{action},y)].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the loss $L$ incurred by eating the mushroom\n",
    "is $L(a=\\mathrm{eat}| x) = 0.2 * \\infty + 0.8 * 0 = \\infty$,\n",
    "whereas the cost of discarding it is\n",
    "$L(a=\\mathrm{discard}| x) = 0.2 * 0 + 0.8 * 1 = 0.8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our caution was justified: as any mycologist would tell us,\n",
    "the above mushroom actually *is* a death cap.\n",
    "Classification can get much more complicated than just\n",
    "binary, multiclass, or even multi-label classification.\n",
    "For instance, there are some variants of classification\n",
    "for addressing hierarchies.\n",
    "Hierarchies assume that there exist some relationships among the many classes.\n",
    "So not all errors are equal---if we must err, we would prefer\n",
    "to misclassify to a related class rather than to a distant class.\n",
    "Usually, this is referred to as *hierarchical classification*.\n",
    "One early example is due to [Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus), who organized the animals in a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of animal classification,\n",
    "it might not be so bad to mistake a poodle for a schnauzer,\n",
    "but our model would pay a huge penalty\n",
    "if it confused a poodle for a dinosaur.\n",
    "Which hierarchy is relevant might depend\n",
    "on how you plan to use the model.\n",
    "For example, rattle snakes and garter snakes\n",
    "might be close on the phylogenetic tree,\n",
    "but mistaking a rattler for a garter could be deadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Some classification problems do not fit neatly\n",
    "into the binary or multiclass classification setups.\n",
    "For example, we could train a normal binary classifier\n",
    "to distinguish cats from dogs.\n",
    "Given the current state of computer vision,\n",
    "we can do this easily, with off-the-shelf tools.\n",
    "Nonetheless, no matter how accurate our model gets,\n",
    "we might find ourselves in trouble when the classifier\n",
    "encounters an image of the Town Musicians of Bremen.\n",

    "and a rooster, a dog, a donkey, and a bird,\n",
    "with some trees in the background.\n",
    "Depending on what we want to do with our model\n",
    "ultimately, treating this as a binary classification problem\n",
    "might not make a lot of sense.\n",
    "Instead, we might want to give the model the option of\n",

    "The problem of learning to predict classes that are\n",
    "*not mutually exclusive* is called multi-label classification.\n",
    "Auto-tagging problems are typically best described\n",
    "as multi-label classification problems.\n",
    "Think of the tags people might apply to posts on a tech blog,\n",
    "e.g., \"machine learning\", \"technology\", \"gadgets\",\n",
    "\"programming languages\", \"linux\", \"cloud computing\", \"AWS\".\n",
    "A typical article might have 5-10 tags applied\n",
    "because these concepts are correlated.\n",
    "Posts about \"cloud computing\" are likely to mention \"AWS\"\n",
    "and posts about \"machine learning\" could also deal\n",
    "with \"programming languages\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to deal with this kind of problem when dealing\n",
    "with the biomedical literature, where correctly tagging articles is important\n",
    "because it allows researchers to do exhaustive reviews of the literature.\n",
    "At the National Library of Medicine, a number of professional annotators\n",
    "go over each article that gets indexed in PubMed\n",
    "to associate it with the relevant terms from MeSH,\n",
    "a collection of roughly 28k tags.\n",
    "This is a time-consuming process and the\n",
    "annotators typically have a one year lag between archiving and tagging.\n",
    "Machine learning can be used here to provide provisional tags\n",
    "until each article can have a proper manual review.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes we do not just want to assign each example to a bucket\n",
    "or to a real value. In the field of information retrieval,\n",
    "we want to impose a ranking on a set of items.\n",
    "Take web search for example, the goal is less to determine whether\n",
    "a particular page is relevant for a query, but rather,\n",
    "which one of the plethora of search results is *most relevant*\n",
    "for a particular user.\n",
    "We really care about the ordering of the relevant search results\n",
    "and our learning algorithm needs to produce ordered subsets\n",
    "of elements from a larger set.\n",

    "between returning ``A B C D E`` and ``C A B E D``.\n",
    "Even if the result set is the same,\n",
    "the ordering within the set matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution to this problem is to first assign\n",
    "to every element in the set a corresponding relevance score\n",
    "and then to retrieve the top-rated elements.\n",
    "[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank),\n",

    "was an early example of such a scoring system but it was\n",

    "is to display a set of relevant items to the user.\n",
    "The main difference is the emphasis on *personalization*\n",
    "to specific users in the context of recommender systems.\n",
    "For instance, for movie recommendations,\n",
    "the results page for a SciFi fan and the results page\n",
    "for a connoisseur of Peter Sellers comedies might differ significantly.\n",
    "Similar problems pop up in other recommendation settings,\n",
    "e.g., for retail products, music, or news recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, customers provide explicit feedback communicating\n",
    "how much they liked a particular product\n",
    "(e.g., the product ratings and reviews on Amazon, IMDB, GoodReads, etc.).\n",
    "In some other cases, they provide implicit feedback,\n",
    "e.g., by skipping titles on a playlist,\n",
    "which might indicate dissatisfaction but might just indicate\n",
    "that the song was inappropriate in context.\n",
    "In the simplest formulations, these systems are trained\n",

    "* Want to beat us, i.e., an adversarial setting like spam filtering (against spammers) or playing a game (vs an opponent)?\n",
    "* Not care (as in many cases)?\n",
    "* Have shifting dynamics (does future data always resemble the past or do the patterns change over time, either naturally or in response to our automated tools)?\n",
    "\n",

    "two settings that explicitly consider interaction with an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in using machine learning\n",
    "to develop an agent that interacts with an environment\n",
    "and takes actions, then you are probably going to wind up\n",
    "focusing on *reinforcement learning* (RL).\n",
    "This might include applications to robotics,\n",
    "to dialogue systems, and even to developing AI for video games.\n",
    "*Deep reinforcement learning* (DRL), which applies\n",
    "deep neural networks to RL problems, has surged in popularity.\n",
    "The breakthrough [deep Q-network that beat humans at Atari games using only the visual input](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/google-ai-plays-atari-like-pros/),\n",
    "and the [AlphaGo program that dethroned the world champion at the board game Go](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/googles-alphago-trounces-humans-also-gives-boost/) are two prominent examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning gives a very general statement of a problem,\n",
    "in which an agent interacts with an environment over a series of *timesteps*.\n",
    "At each timestep $t$, the agent receives some observation $o_t$\n",
    "from the environment and must choose an action $a_t$\n",
    "that is subsequently transmitted back to the environment\n",
    "via some mechanism (sometimes called an actuator).\n",
    "Finally, the agent receives a reward $r_t$ from the environment.\n",
    "The agent then receives a subsequent observation,\n",
    "and chooses a subsequent action, and so on.\n",
    "The behavior of an RL agent is governed by a *policy*.\n",
    "In short, a *policy* is just a function that maps\n",
    "from observations (of the environment) to actions.\n",
    "The goal of reinforcement learning is to produce a good policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The interaction between reinforcement learning and an environment.](../img/rl-environment.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard to overstate the generality of the RL framework.\n",
    "For example, we can cast any supervised learning problem as an RL problem.\n",
    "Say we had a classification problem.\n",
    "We could create an RL agent with one *action* corresponding to each class.\n",
    "We could then create an environment which gave a reward\n",
    "that was exactly equal to the loss function\n",
    "from the original supervised problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, RL can also address many problems\n",
    "that supervised learning cannot.\n",
    "For example, in supervised learning we always expect\n",
    "that the training input comes associated with the correct label.\n",
    "But in RL, we do not assume that for each observation,\n",
    "the environment tells us the optimal action.\n",
    "In general, we just get some reward.\n",
    "Moreover, the environment may not even tell us which actions led to the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for example the game of chess.\n",
    "The only real reward signal comes at the end of the game\n",
    "when we either win, which we might assign a reward of 1,\n",
    "or when we lose, which we could assign a reward of -1.\n",
    "So reinforcement learners must deal with the *credit assignment problem*:\n",
    "determining which actions to credit or blame for an outcome.\n",
    "The same goes for an employee who gets a promotion on October 11.\n",
    "That promotion likely reflects a large number\n",
    "of well-chosen actions over the previous year.\n",
    "Getting more promotions in the future requires figuring out\n",
    "what actions along the way led to the promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learners may also have to deal\n",
    "with the problem of partial observability.\n",
    "That is, the current observation might not\n",
    "tell you everything about your current state.\n",
    "Say a cleaning robot found itself trapped\n",
    "in one of many identical closets in a house.\n",
    "Inferring the precise location (and thus state) of the robot\n",
    "might require considering its previous observations before entering the closet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at any given point, reinforcement learners\n",
    "might know of one good policy,\n",
    "but there might be many other better policies\n",
    "that the agent has never tried.\n",
    "The reinforcement learner must constantly choose\n",
    "whether to *exploit* the best currently-known strategy as a policy,\n",
    "or to *explore* the space of strategies,\n",
    "potentially giving up some short-run reward in exchange for knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MDPs, bandits, and friends\n",
    "\n",
    "The general reinforcement learning problem\n",
    "is a very general setting.\n",
    "Actions affect subsequent observations.\n",
    "Rewards are only observed corresponding to the chosen actions.\n",
    "The environment may be either fully or partially observed.\n",
    "Accounting for all this complexity at once may ask too much of researchers.\n",

    "we call the RL problem a *Markov Decision Process* (MDP).\n",

    "Although many deep learning methods are recent inventions,\n",
    "humans have held the desire to analyze data\n",
    "and to predict future outcomes for centuries.\n",
    "In fact, much of natural science has its roots in this.\n",
    "For instance, the Bernoulli distribution is named after\n",
    "[Jacob Bernoulli (1655-1705)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli), and the Gaussian distribution was discovered\n",
    "by [Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss).\n",

    "in the natural sciences---for instance, Ohm's law\n",
    "relating current and voltage in a resistor\n",
    "is perfectly described by a linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the middle ages, mathematicians had a keen intuition of estimates.\n",
    "For instance, the geometry book of [Jacob Köbel (1460-1533)](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasures-jacob-kobels-geometry) illustrates\n",

    "2 men with the shortest and longest feet respectively were sent away,\n",

    "has as long and enduring a history as its productive use\n",
    "in industry and the natural sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second influence for machine learning came from Information Theory\n",
    "[(Claude Shannon, 1916-2001)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) and the Theory of computation via [Alan Turing (1912-1954)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing).\n",
    "Turing posed the question \"can machines think?”\n",
    "in his famous paper [Computing machinery and intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence) (Mind, October 1950).\n",

    "* The alternation of linear and nonlinear processing units, often referred to as *layers*.\n",

    "After initial rapid progress, research in neural networks\n",
    "languished from around 1995 until 2005.\n",
    "This was due to a number of reasons.\n",
    "Training a network is computationally very expensive.\n",
    "While RAM was plentiful at the end of the past century,\n",
    "computational power was scarce.\n",
    "Second, datasets were relatively small.\n",
    "In fact, Fisher's Iris dataset from 1932\n",
    "was a popular tool for testing the efficacy of algorithms.\n",
    "MNIST with its 60,000 handwritten digits was considered huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the scarcity of data and computation,\n",
    "strong statistical tools such as Kernel Methods,\n",
    "Decision Trees and Graphical Models proved empirically superior.\n",
    "Unlike neural networks, they did not require weeks to train\n",

    "* Novel methods for capacity control, such as Dropout\n",
    "  :cite:`Srivastava.Hinton.Krizhevsky.ea.2014`\n",
    "  have helped to mitigate the danger of overfitting.\n",
    "  This was achieved by applying noise injection :cite:`Bishop.1995`\n",
    "  throughout the network, replacing weights by random variables\n",
    "  for training purposes.\n",
    "* Attention mechanisms solved a second problem\n",
    "  that had plagued statistics for over a century:\n",
    "  how to increase the memory and complexity of a system without\n",
    "  increasing the number of learnable parameters.\n",
    "  :cite:`Bahdanau.Cho.Bengio.2014` found an elegant solution\n",
    "  by using what can only be viewed as a learnable pointer structure.\n",
    "  Rather than having to remember an entire sentence, e.g.,\n",
    "  for machine translation in a fixed-dimensional representation,\n",
    "  all that needed to be stored was a pointer to the intermediate state\n",
    "  of the translation process. This allowed for significantly\n",
    "  increased accuracy for long sentences, since the model\n",
    "  no longer needed to remember the entire sentence before\n",
    "  commencing the generation of a new sentence.\n",
    "* Multi-stage designs, e.g., via the Memory Networks (MemNets)\n",
    "  :cite:`Sukhbaatar.Weston.Fergus.ea.2015` and the Neural Programmer-Interpreter :cite:`Reed.De-Freitas.2015`\n",
    "  allowed statistical modelers to describe iterative approaches to reasoning. These tools allow for an internal state of the deep network\n",
    "  to be modified repeatedly, thus carrying out subsequent steps\n",
    "  in a chain of reasoning, similar to how a processor\n",
    "  can modify memory for a computation.\n",
    "* Another key development was the invention of GANs\n",
    "  :cite:`Goodfellow.Pouget-Abadie.Mirza.ea.2014`.\n",
    "  Traditionally, statistical methods for density estimation\n",
    "  and generative models focused on finding proper probability distributions\n",
    "  and (often approximate) algorithms for sampling from them.\n",
    "  As a result, these algorithms were largely limited by the lack of\n",
    "  flexibility inherent in the statistical models.\n",
    "  The crucial innovation in GANs was to replace the sampler\n",
    "  by an arbitrary algorithm with differentiable parameters.\n",
    "  These are then adjusted in such a way that the discriminator\n",
    "  (effectively a two-sample test) cannot distinguish fake from real data.\n",
    "  Through the ability to use arbitrary algorithms to generate data,\n",
    "  it opened up density estimation to a wide variety of techniques.\n",
    "  Examples of galloping Zebras :cite:`Zhu.Park.Isola.ea.2017`\n",
    "  and of fake celebrity faces :cite:`Karras.Aila.Laine.ea.2017` \n",
    "  are both testimony to this progress.\n",

    "  the large amounts of data available for training.\n",
    "  Over the past decade the ability to build parallel\n",

    "  One of the key challenges in designing scalable algorithms\n",
    "  is that the workhorse of deep learning optimization,\n",
    "  stochastic gradient descent, relies on relatively\n",
    "  small minibatches of data to be processed.\n",
    "  At the same time, small batches limit the efficiency of GPUs.\n",
    "  Hence, training on 1024 GPUs with a minibatch size of,\n",
    "  say 32 images per batch amounts to an aggregate minibatch\n",
    "  of 32k images. Recent work, first by Li :cite:`Li.2017`,\n",
    "  and subsequently by :cite:`You.Gitman.Ginsburg.2017`\n",
    "  and :cite:`Jia.Song.He.ea.2018` pushed the size up to 64k observations,\n",
    "  reducing training time for ResNet50 on ImageNet to less than 7 minutes.\n",
    "  For comparison---initially training times were measured in the order of days.\n",
    "* The ability to parallelize computation has also contributed quite crucially\n",
    "  to progress in reinforcement learning, at least whenever simulation is an\n",
    "  option. This has led to significant progress in computers achieving\n",
    "  superhuman performance in Go, Atari games, Starcraft, and in physics\n",
    "  simulations (e.g., using MuJoCo). See e.g.,\n",
    "  :cite:`Silver.Huang.Maddison.ea.2016` for a description\n",
    "  of how to achieve this in AlphaGo. In a nutshell,\n",
    "  reinforcement learning works best if plenty of (state, action, reward) triples are available, i.e., whenever it is possible to try out lots of things to learn how they relate to each\n",
    "  other. Simulation provides such an avenue.\n",
    "* Deep Learning frameworks have played a crucial role\n",
    "  in disseminating ideas. The first generation of frameworks\n",

    "  [Torch](https://github.com/torch), and\n",

    "  often used via its high level API [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK), [Caffe 2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2), and [Apache MxNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet). The third generation of tools, namely imperative tools for deep learning,\n",
    "  was arguably spearheaded by [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer),\n",
    "  which used a syntax similar to Python NumPy to describe models.\n",

    "The division of labor between systems researchers building better tools\n",

    "putting it firmly into the grasp of programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence has a long history of delivering results\n",
    "that would be difficult to accomplish otherwise.\n",
    "For instance, mail is sorted using optical character recognition.\n",
    "These systems have been deployed since the 90s\n",
    "(this is, after all, the source of the famous MNIST and USPS sets of handwritten digits).\n",
    "The same applies to reading checks for bank deposits and scoring\n",
    "creditworthiness of applicants.\n",
    "Financial transactions are checked for fraud automatically.\n",
    "This forms the backbone of many e-commerce payment systems,\n",
    "such as PayPal, Stripe, AliPay, WeChat, Apple, Visa, MasterCard.\n",
    "Computer programs for chess have been competitive for decades.\n",
    "Machine learning feeds search, recommendation, personalization\n",
    "and ranking on the Internet. In other words, artificial intelligence\n",
    "and machine learning are pervasive, albeit often hidden from sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only recently that AI has been in the limelight, mostly due to\n",
    "solutions to problems that were considered intractable previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intelligent assistants, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google's\n",
    "  assistant are able to answer spoken questions with a reasonable degree of\n",
    "  accuracy. This includes menial tasks such as turning on light switches (a boon to the disabled) up to making barber's appointments and offering phone support dialog. This is likely the most noticeable sign that AI is affecting our lives.\n",
    "* A key ingredient in digital assistants is the ability to recognize speech\n",
    "  accurately. Gradually the accuracy of such systems has increased to the point\n",
    "  where they reach human parity :cite:`Xiong.Wu.Alleva.ea.2018` for certain\n",
    "  applications.\n",
    "* Object recognition likewise has come a long way. Estimating the object in a\n",
    "  picture was a fairly challenging task in 2010. On the ImageNet benchmark\n",
    "  :cite:`Lin.Lv.Zhu.ea.2010` achieved a top-5 error rate of 28%. By 2017,\n",
    "  :cite:`Hu.Shen.Sun.2018` reduced this error rate to 2.25%. Similarly, stunning\n",
    "  results have been achieved for identifying birds, or diagnosing skin cancer.\n",
    "* Games used to be a bastion of human intelligence.\n",
    "  Starting from TDGammon [23], a program for playing Backgammon\n",
    "  using temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning,\n",
    "  algorithmic and computational progress has led to algorithms\n",
    "  for a wide range of applications. Unlike Backgammon,\n",
    "  chess has a much more complex state space and set of actions.\n",
    "  DeepBlue beat Garry Kasparov, Campbell et al.\n",
    "  :cite:`Campbell.Hoane-Jr.Hsu.2002`, using massive parallelism,\n",
    "  special purpose hardware and efficient search through the game tree.\n",
    "  Go is more difficult still, due to its huge state space.\n",
    "  AlphaGo reached human parity in 2015, :cite:`Silver.Huang.Maddison.ea.2016` using Deep Learning combined with Monte Carlo tree sampling.\n",
    "  The challenge in Poker was that the state space is\n",
    "  large and it is not fully observed (we do not know the opponents'\n",
    "  cards). Libratus exceeded human performance in Poker using efficiently\n",
    "  structured strategies :cite:`Brown.Sandholm.2017`.\n",
    "  This illustrates the impressive progress in games\n",
    "  and the fact that advanced algorithms played a crucial part in them.\n",
    "* Another indication of progress in AI is the advent of self-driving cars\n",
    "  and trucks. While full autonomy is not quite within reach yet,\n",
    "  excellent progress has been made in this direction,\n",
    "  with companies such as Tesla, NVIDIA,\n",
    "  and Waymo shipping products that enable at least partial autonomy.\n",
    "  What makes full autonomy so challenging is that proper driving\n",
    "  requires the ability to perceive, to reason and to incorporate rules\n",

    "  The rest is heavily tuned by engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the above list barely scratches the surface of where machine learning has impacted practical applications. For instance, robotics, logistics, computational biology, particle physics, and astronomy owe some of their most impressive recent advances at least in parts to machine learning. ML is thus becoming a ubiquitous tool for engineers and scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, the question of the AI apocalypse, or the AI singularity\n",
    "has been raised in non-technical articles on AI.\n",
    "The fear is that somehow machine learning systems\n",
    "will become sentient and decide independently from their programmers\n",
    "(and masters) about things that directly affect the livelihood of humans.\n",
    "To some extent, AI already affects the livelihood of humans\n",
    "in an immediate way---creditworthiness is assessed automatically,\n",
    "autopilots mostly navigate vehicles, decisions about\n",
    "whether to grant bail use statistical data as input.\n",
    "More frivolously, we can ask Alexa to switch on the coffee machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we are far from a sentient AI system\n",
    "that is ready to manipulate its human creators (or burn their coffee).\n",
    "First, AI systems are engineered, trained and deployed in a specific,\n",
    "goal-oriented manner. While their behavior might give the illusion\n",
    "of general intelligence, it is a combination of rules, heuristics\n",
    "and statistical models that underlie the design.\n",
    "Second, at present tools for *artificial general intelligence*\n",
    "simply do not exist that are able to improve themselves,\n",
    "reason about themselves, and that are able to modify,\n",
    "extend and improve their own architecture\n",
    "while trying to solve general tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A much more pressing concern is how AI is being used in our daily lives.\n",
    "It is likely that many menial tasks fulfilled by truck drivers\n",
    "and shop assistants can and will be automated.\n",
    "Farm robots will likely reduce the cost for organic farming\n",
    "but they will also automate harvesting operations.\n",
    "This phase of the industrial revolution\n",
    "may have profound consequences on large swaths of society\n",
    "(truck drivers and shop assistants are some\n",
    "of the most common jobs in many states).\n",
    "Furthermore, statistical models, when applied without care\n",
    "can lead to racial, gender or age bias and raise\n",
    "reasonable concerns about procedural fairness\n",
    "if automated to drive consequential decisions.\n",
    "It is important to ensure that these algorithms are used with care.\n",
    "With what we know today, this strikes us a much more pressing concern\n",
    "than the potential of malevolent superintelligence to destroy humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine learning studies how computer systems can leverage *experience* (often data) to improve performance at specific tasks. It combines ideas from statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, and optimization. Often, it is used as a means of implementing artificially-intelligent solutions.\n",
    "* As a class of machine learning, representational learning focuses on how to automatically find the appropriate way to represent data. This is often accomplished by a progression of learned transformations.\n",
    "* Much of the recent progress in deep learning has been triggered by an abundance of data arising from cheap sensors and Internet-scale applications, and by significant progress in computation, mostly through GPUs.\n",
    "* Whole system optimization is a key component in obtaining good performance. The availability of efficient deep learning frameworks has made design and implementation of this significantly easier.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which parts of code that you are currently writing could be \"learned\", i.e., improved by learning and automatically determining design choices that are made in your code? Does your code include heuristic design choices?\n",
    "1. Which problems that you encounter have many examples for how to solve them, yet no specific way to automate them? These may be prime candidates for using deep learning.\n",
    "1. Viewing the development of artificial intelligence as a new industrial revolution, what is the relationship between algorithms and data? Is it similar to steam engines and coal (what is the fundamental difference)?\n",
    "1. Where else can you apply the end-to-end training approach? Physics? Engineering? Econometrics?\n"
