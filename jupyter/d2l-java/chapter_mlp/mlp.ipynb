    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If our labels truly were related \n",
    "to our input data by a linear function, \n",
    "then this approach would be sufficient.\n",
    "But linearity is a *strong assumption*.\n",

    "For example, linearity implies the *weaker*\n",

    "In this case too, we might resolve the problem \n",
    "with some clever preprocessing. \n",
    "Namely, we might use the *distance* from 37°C as our feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about classifying images of cats and dogs?\n",
    "Should increasing the intensity \n",
    "of the pixel at location (13, 17)\n",
    "always increase (or always decrease) \n",

    "\n",
    "* The multilayer perceptron adds one or multiple fully-connected hidden layers between the output and input layers and transforms the output of the hidden layer via an activation function.\n",
    "* Commonly-used activation functions include the ReLU function, the sigmoid function, and the tanh function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the derivative of the tanh and the pReLU activation function.\n",
    "1. Show that a multilayer perceptron using only ReLU (or pReLU) constructs a continuous piecewise linear function.\n",
    "1. Show that $\\mathrm{tanh}(x) + 1 = 2 \\mathrm{sigmoid}(2x)$.\n",
    "1. Assume we have a multilayer perceptron *without* nonlinearities between the layers. In particular, assume that we have $d$ input dimensions, $d$ output dimensions and that one of the layers has only $d/2$ dimensions. Show that this network is less expressive (powerful) than a single layer perceptron.\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a nonlinearity that applies to one minibatch at a time. What kinds of problems do you expect this to cause?\n",
