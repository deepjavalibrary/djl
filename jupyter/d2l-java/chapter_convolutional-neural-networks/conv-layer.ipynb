    "are a (slight) misnomer, since the operations they express\n",
    "are more accurately described as cross correlations.\n",
    "In a convolutional layer, an input array\n",
    "and a *correlation kernel* array are combined\n",
    "to produce an output array through a cross-correlation operation.\n",
    "Let's ignore channels for now and see how this works \n",
    "with two-dimensional data and hidden representations.\n",
    "In :numref:`fig_correlation`, \n",
    "the input is a two-dimensional array\n",
    "with a height of 3 and width of 3.\n",
    "We mark the shape of the array as $3 \\times 3$ or ($3$, $3$).\n",
    "The height and width of the kernel are both $2$.\n",
    "Note that in the deep learning research community,\n",
    "this object may be referred to as *a convolutional kernel*, \n",
    "*a filter*, or simply the layer's *weights*.\n",
    "The shape of the kernel window\n",
    "is given by the height and width of the kernel\n",
    "(here it is $2 \\times 2$).\n",
