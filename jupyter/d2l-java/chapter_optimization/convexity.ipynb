    "# Convexity\n",
    ":label:`sec_convexity`\n",
    "\n",
    "Convexity plays a vital role in the design of optimization algorithms. This is largely due to the fact that it is much easier to analyze and test algorithms in this context. In other words, if the algorithm performs poorly even in the convex setting we should not hope to see great results otherwise. Furthermore, even though the optimization problems in deep learning are generally nonconvex, they often exhibit some properties of convex ones near local minima. This can lead to exciting new optimization variants such as :cite:`Izmailov.Podoprikhin.Garipov.ea.2018`. \n",

    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are the basis of convexity. Simply put, a set $X$ in a vector space is convex if for any $a, b \\in X$ the line segment connecting $a$ and $b$ is also in $X$. In mathematical terms this means that for all $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$ we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda \\cdot a + (1-\\lambda) \\cdot b \\in X \\text{ whenever } a, b \\in X.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds a bit abstract. Consider the picture :numref:`fig_pacman`. The first set is not convex since there are line segments that are not contained in it. The other two sets suffer no such problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Three shapes, the left one is nonconvex, the others are convex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/master/img/pacman.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_pacman`\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions on their own are not particularly useful unless you can do something with them. In this case we can look at unions and intersections as shown in :numref:`fig_convex_intersect`. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are convex sets. Then $X \\cap Y$ is also convex. To see this, consider any $a, b \\in X \\cap Y$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are convex, the line segments connecting $a$ and $b$ are contained in both $X$ and $Y$. Given that, they also need to be contained in $X \\cap Y$, thus proving our first theorem. \n",

    "We can strengthen this result with little effort: given convex sets $X_i$, their intersection $\\cap_{i} X_i$ is convex. \n",
    "To see that the converse is not true, consider two disjoint sets $X \\cap Y = \\emptyset$. Now pick $a \\in X$ and $b \\in Y$. The line segment in :numref:`fig_nonconvex` connecting $a$ and $b$ needs to contain some part that is neither in $X$ nor $Y$, since we assumed that $X \\cap Y = \\emptyset$. Hence the line segment is not in $X \\cup Y$ either, thus proving that in general unions of convex sets need not be convex. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The union of two convex sets need not be convex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/master/img/nonconvex.svg)\n",
    ":label:`fig_nonconvex`\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the problems in deep learning are defined on convex domains. For instance $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is a convex set (after all, the line between any two points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ remains in $\\mathbb{R}^d$). In some cases we work with variables of bounded length, such as balls of radius $r$ as defined by $\\{\\mathbf{x} | \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\text{ and } \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2 \\leq r\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have convex sets we can introduce convex functions $f$. Given a convex set $X$ a function defined on it $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is convex if for all $x, x' \\in X$ and for all $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$ we have \n",
    "\n",

In this case the parameters $\\mathbf{x}$ are constrained to the unit ball. If a second constraint is $c_2(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{x} + b$, then this corresponds to all $\\mathbf{x}$ lying on a halfspace. Satisfying both constraints simultaneously amounts to selecting a slice of a ball as the constraint set. \n",

    "### Lagrange Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, solving a constrained optimization problem is difficult. One way of addressing it stems from physics with a rather simple intuition. Imagine a ball inside a box. The ball will roll to the place that is lowest and the forces of gravity will be balanced out with the forces that the sides of the box can impose on the ball. In short, the gradient of the objective function (i.e., gravity) will be offset by the gradient of the constraint function (need to remain inside the box by virtue of the walls \"pushing back\"). Note that any constraint that is not active (i.e., the ball does not touch the wall) will not be able to exert any force on the ball. \n",
    "\n",
    "Skipping over the derivation of the Lagrange function $L$ (see e.g., the book by Boyd and Vandenberghe for details :cite:`Boyd.Vandenberghe.2004`) the above reasoning can be expressed via the following saddlepoint optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathbf{x},\\alpha) = f(\\mathbf{x}) + \\sum_i \\alpha_i c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\text{ where } \\alpha_i \\geq 0.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the variables $\\alpha_i$ are the so-called *Lagrange Multipliers* that ensure that a constraint is properly enforced. They are chosen just large enough to ensure that $c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\leq 0$ for all $i$. For instance, for any $\\mathbf{x}$ for which $c_i(\\mathbf{x}) < 0$ naturally, we'd end up picking $\\alpha_i = 0$. Moreover, this is a *saddlepoint* optimization problem where one wants to *maximize* $L$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and simultaneously *minimize* it with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$. There is a rich body of literature explaining how to arrive at the function $L(\\mathbf{x}, \\alpha)$. For our purposes it is sufficient to know that the saddlepoint of $L$ is where the original constrained optimization problem is solved optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of satisfying constrained optimization problems at least approximately is to adapt the Lagrange function $L$. Rather than satisfying $c_i(\\mathbf{x}) \\leq 0$ we simply add $\\alpha_i c_i(\\mathbf{x})$ to the objective function $f(x)$. This ensures that the constraints will not be violated too badly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we have been using this trick all along. Consider weight decay in :numref:`sec_weight_decay`. In it we add $\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2$ to the objective function to ensure that $\\mathbf{w}$ does not grow too large. Using the constrained optimization point of view we can see that this will ensure that $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 - r^2 \\leq 0$ for some radius $r$. Adjusting the value of $\\lambda$ allows us to vary the size of $\\mathbf{w}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, adding penalties is a good way of ensuring approximate constraint satisfaction. In practice this turns out to be much more robust than exact satisfaction. Furthermore, for nonconvex problems many of the properties that make the exact approach so appealing in the convex case (e.g., optimality) no longer hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative strategy for satisfying constraints are projections. Again, we encountered them before, e.g., when dealing with gradient clipping in :numref:`sec_rnn_scratch`. There we ensured that a gradient has length bounded by $c$ via\n",

    "It is thus the closest point in $X$ to $\\mathbf{x}$. This sounds a bit abstract. :numref:`fig_projections` explains it somewhat more clearly. In it we have two convex sets, a circle and a diamond. Points inside the set (yellow) remain unchanged. Points outside the set (black) are mapped to the closest point inside the set (red). While for $\\ell_2$ balls this leaves the direction unchanged, this need not be the case in general, as can be seen in the case of the diamond. \n",

    "1. Assume that we want to verify convexity of a set by drawing all lines between points within the set and checking whether the lines are contained. \n",
    "    * Prove that it is sufficient to check only the points on the boundary.\n",
    "    * Prove that it is sufficient to check only the vertices of the set.\n",
    "1. Denote by $B_p[r] := \\{\\mathbf{x} | \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\text{ and } \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_p \\leq r\\}$ the ball of radius $r$ using the $p$-norm. Prove that $B_p[r]$ is convex for all $p \\geq 1$.\n",
    "1. Given convex functions $f$ and $g$ show that $\\mathrm{max}(f, g)$ is convex, too. Prove that $\\mathrm{min}(f, g)$ is not convex.\n",
    "1. Prove that the normalization of the softmax function is convex. More specifically prove the convexity of \n",
    "    $f(x) = \\log \\sum_i \\exp(x_i)$.\n",
    "1. Prove that linear subspaces are convex sets, i.e., $X = \\{\\mathbf{x} | \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\\}$. \n",
    "1. Prove that in the case of linear subspaces with $\\mathbf{b} = 0$ the projection $\\mathrm{Proj}_X$ can be written as $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{x}$ for some matrix $\\mathbf{M}$. \n",
    "1. Show that for convex twice differentiable functions $f$ we can write $f(x + \\epsilon) = f(x) + \\epsilon f'(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon^2 f''(x + \\xi)$ for some $\\xi \\in [0, \\epsilon]$.\n",
    "1. Given a vector $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|_1 > 1$ compute the projection on the $\\ell_1$ unit ball. \n",
    "    * As intermediate step write out the penalized objective $\\|\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}'\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\mathbf{w}'\\|_1$ and compute the solution for a given $\\lambda > 0$. \n",
    "    * Can you find the 'right' value of $\\lambda$ without a lot of trial and error? \n",
    "1. Given a convex set $X$ and two vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ prove that projections never increase distances, i.e., $\\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\| \\geq \\|\\mathrm{Proj}_X(\\mathbf{x}) - \\mathrm{Proj}_X(\\mathbf{y})\\|$."
