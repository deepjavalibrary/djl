This is due to the stochastic nature of the gradient. That is, even when we arrive near the minimum, we are still subject to the uncertainty injected by the instantaneous gradient via $\\eta \\nabla f_i(\\mathbf{x})$. Even after 50 steps the quality is still not so good. Even worse, it will not improve after additional steps (we encourage the reader to experiment with a larger number of steps to confirm this on his own). This leaves us with the only alternative---change the learning rate $\\eta$. However, if we pick this too small, we will not make any meaningful progress initially.

    "So far we have played a bit fast and loose when it comes to talking about stochastic gradient descent. We posited that we draw instances $x_i$, typically with labels $y_i$ from some distribution $p(x, y)$ and that we use this to update the weights $w$ in some manner. In particular, for a finite sample size we simply argued that the discrete distribution $p(x, y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\delta_{x_i}(x) \\delta_{y_i}(y)$ allows us to perform SGD over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not really what we did. In the toy examples in the current section we simply added noise to an otherwise non-stochastic gradient, i.e., we pretended to have pairs $(x_i, y_i)$. It turns out that this is justified here (see the exercises for a detailed discussion). More troubling is that in all previous discussions we clearly did not do this. Instead we iterated over all instances exactly once. To see why this is preferable consider the converse, namely that we are sampling $n$ observations from the discrete distribution with replacement. The probability of choosing an element $i$ at random is $N^{-1}$. Thus to choose it at least once is\n",

    "A similar reasoning shows that the probability of picking a sample exactly once is given by ${N \\choose 1} N^{-1} (1-N^{-1})^{N-1} = \\frac{N-1}{N} (1-N^{-1})^{N} \\approx e^{-1} \\approx 0.37$. This leads to an increased variance and decreased data efficiency relative to sampling without replacement. Hence, in practice we perform the latter (and this is the default choice throughout this book). Last note that repeated passes through the dataset traverse it in a *different* random order.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* For convex problems we can prove that for a wide choice of learning rates Stochastic Gradient Descent will converge to the optimal solution.\n",
    "* For deep learning this is generally not the case. However, the analysis of convex problems gives us useful insight into how to approach optimization, namely to reduce the learning rate progressively, albeit not too quickly.\n",
    "* Problems occur when the learning rate is too small or too large. In practice  a suitable learning rate is often found only after multiple experiments.\n",
    "* When there are more examples in the training dataset, it costs more to compute each iteration for gradient descent, so SGD is preferred in these cases.\n",
    "* Optimality guarantees for SGD are in general not available in nonconvex cases since the number of local minima that require checking might well be exponential.\n",
