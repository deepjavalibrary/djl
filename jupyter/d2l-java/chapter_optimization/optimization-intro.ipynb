    "In this section, we will discuss the relationship between optimization and deep learning as well as the challenges of using optimization in deep learning. For a deep learning problem, we will usually define a loss function first. Once we have the loss function, we can use an optimization algorithm in attempt to minimize the loss. In optimization, a loss function is often referred to as the objective function of the optimization problem. By tradition and convention most optimization algorithms are concerned with *minimization*. If we ever need to maximize an objective there is a simple solution: just flip the sign on the objective.\n",

When the numerical solution of an optimization problem is near the local optimum, the numerical solution obtained by the final iteration may only minimize the objective function locally, rather than globally, as the gradient of the objective function's solutions approaches or becomes zero. Only some degree of noise might knock the parameter out of the local minimum.

Consider the function $f(x) = x^3$. Its first and second derivative vanish for $x=0$. Optimization might stall at the point, even though it is not a minimum."

Consequently optimization will get stuck for a long time before we make progress. This turns out to be one of the reasons that training deep learning models was quite tricky prior to the introduction of the ReLU activation function.\n",
