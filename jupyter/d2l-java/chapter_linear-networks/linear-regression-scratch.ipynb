    "including the data pipeline, the model,\n",
    "the loss function, and the gradient descent optimizer.\n",
    "While modern deep learning frameworks can automate nearly all of this work,\n",

    "understanding how things work under the hood will prove handy.\n",
    "In this section, we will rely only on `NDArray` and `GradientCollector`.\n",

    "\n",
    "We saw how a deep network can be implemented\n",
    "and optimized from scratch, using just `NDArray` and `GradientCollector`,\n",
    "without any need for defining layers, fancy optimizers, etc.\n",
    "This only scratches the surface of what is possible.\n",
    "In the following sections, we will describe additional models\n",
    "based on the concepts that we have just introduced\n",
    "and learn how to implement them more concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What would happen if we were to initialize the weights $\\mathbf{w} = 0$. Would the algorithm still work?\n",
    "1. Assume that you are [Georg Simon Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm) trying to come up with a model between voltage and current. Can you use `GradientCollector` to learn the parameters of your model.\n",
    "1. Can you use [Planck's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law) to determine the temperature of an object using spectral energy density?\n",
    "1. What are the problems you might encounter if you wanted to extend `GradientCollector` to second derivatives? How would you fix them?\n",
    "1.  Why is the `reshape` function needed in the `squaredLoss` function?\n",
    "1. Experiment using different learning rates to find out how fast the loss function value drops.\n",
    "1. If the number of examples cannot be divided by the batch size, what happens to the `dataset.getData` function's behavior?\n"
